# Plate-Art-Designer
This is a repo for creating beautiful Agar plate art with Opentron for HTGAA
Here is a video that I made on how to use it.

# Okay so the document is finsihed
### If you wan't to contribute there are some ideas you can see below(or you can come up with new one yourself)



## To-do
add the code base

add tutorial on how to use in Readme.md with images.

also add the collab page 

create a github pages for the converter

Write a disclaimer about risks of converting from collab to opentron(there might be some unexpected things so please use it with your cation as this is 
just a demo for collab and haven't been tested for safety for opentron)

Add contribution( love to add or make this better with you!) 

and more ...

#Some Ideas to implement(You can contribute!):
Making a time estimator: base on the number of points estimiate how long it will take for Opentron to run the code.

Make the code or the data more efficient: I think we can have similiar resulotion with way less data so finding ways to optimize data or the code so it needs less data there for more speed.

Change the code for collab so it will accept more coler options

Making the layout look nicer and beautiful
